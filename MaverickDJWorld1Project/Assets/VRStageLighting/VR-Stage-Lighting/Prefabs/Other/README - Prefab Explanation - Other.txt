Welcome to the "Other" prefabs folder of VRSL. This is where many imporant tools to use VRSL properly are found. This will be a short description of each.

PanTiltTarget - The default target for many of the "Mover" variants of the Spot Lights.

VRSL-DMX-uDesktopDuplicationReader - This a prefab screen that can capture your desktop screen at runtime with the DMX camera set up. Use this prefab to be able to send DMX node data to the lights directly from your computer to Unity.

VRSL-DMX-USharpVideoReader - This is a prefab of the USharpVideo Player that is set up with the DMX Camera. This will allow you to setup a world with a video player that can read DMX signals from a video/stream. You can modify this prefab to work with other video players as well.

VRSL-DMX-VideoReader - This is a prefab to play regular mp4 videos inside of the Unity Editor and read DMX from. Used in the "RecordedVideo" demo scene.

VRSL-LocalUIControlPanel - This is a Local control panel to control different settings of the lights for comfort reasons. It is highly recommended to have this panel in the world with VRSL  that is easily accessible to users so that they can adjust the lights to their liking.

Legacy DMX Folder - the same prefab video/screen players but with the legacy version of the DMX Camera.
